	information we gather.
	<br/>
	Information You Give Us: We receive and store any information you enter on
	our DEIKHO Web site/App or give us in any other way. Where applicable, you
	may choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be
	able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that
	you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing
	future shopping for you, improving our stores, and communicating with you.
</p>
<p>
	i. Automatic Information: We receive and store certain types of information
	whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites/Apps, we
	use "cookies" and we obtain certain types of information when you access
	DEIKHO.
</p>
<p>
	ii. Mobile: When you download or use apps created by DEIKHO or our
	subsidiaries, we may receive information about your location and your
	mobile device, including a unique identifier for your device. We may use
	this information to provide you with location-based services, such as
	search results, and other personalized content. Most mobile devices allow
	you to turn off location services.
</p>
<p>
	iii. E-mail Communications: To help us make e-mails more useful and
	interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from
	DEIKHO if your computer supports such capabilities. We also compare our
	customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid
	sending unnecessary messages to our customers.
</p>
<p>
	iv. Information from Other Sources: We might receive information about you
	from other sources and add it to our account information.

	2. What About Cookies?
</p>
<p>
	The Help feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser
	from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you
	receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally,
	you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as
	Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the Web site
	of its manufacturer. Because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of
	DEIKHO&#1570;'s essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned
	on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will

	information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law;
